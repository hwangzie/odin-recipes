    <p>Perfect pancakes are <strong>easier</strong>  to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Flour:</strong> This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li> <strong>Sugar:</strong> Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
        <li> <strong>Baking Powder:</strong> Baking powder makes them light and fluffy.</li>
        <li> <strong>Salt:</strong>A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
        <li> <strong>Milk:</strong> Milk is the base of the batter.</li>
        <li> <strong>Egg:</strong>A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>
        <li> <strong>Butter:</strong> Butter adds flavor and richness.</li>
    </ul>
